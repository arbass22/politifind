\subsubsection*{Team Writeup}

\textbf{Overview} \\

The politifind project aims to make political data more accessible to the average person. The project aims to be easy searchable by items such as politicians, bills, and committees. Other data such as how politicians vote on bills and actions on bills will also be available. In addition, users will eventually be able to provide their own input on certain items, such as the popularity of a bill, and this will be available to all viewers. \\

NOTE: We have created a user for whoever is grading this. You can login with username ``grader'' and password ``compsci326'' \\

\n\textbf{Problems/Successes} \\

\n\textbf{Team Choice} \\

For our team choice, we are hoping to integrate the Algolia search API (\url{https://www.algolia.com/}) to make a fast and scalable search functionality that will allow for very efficient searching of the data in our application. Politifind has a ton of data, from thousands of bills to hundreds of politicians and their various voting data, and more. A quick and easy searching function would contribute well to our overall goal of Politifind, which is to make this political data more intuitively and easily accessible to the average person.

I initially worked on transitioning all of our mock data to real data. Now, every bill, politician, vote, committee, etc. information is accurate instead of random. This allows our Poltifind users to subscribe to real information now instead of random information. Next, I modified our models to include a one-to-one mapping from a Django auth user to our Politifind user profile, so they could enter additional information about their political views, and have their own subscriptions. Lastly, I templated the navbar and the profile page such that a user can only get to the profile page if they are logged in, and once they are logged in they can either logout or view/edit their profile. I also hooked up the user's subscriptions into the template for the profile.\\

In this project I was solely responsible for all voting functionality with the user.  This includes templating the bill page, creating the vote endpoint, and modifying the bill view with the appropriate contexts.\\
