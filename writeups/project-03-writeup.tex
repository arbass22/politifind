\textbf{Overview}

The politifind project aims to make political data more accessible to the average person. The project aims to be easy searchable by items such as politicians, bills, and committees. Other data such as how politicians vote on bills and actions on bills will also be available. In addition, users will eventually be able to provide their own input on certain items, such as the popularity of a bill, and this will be available to all viewers.

\n\textbf{Problems/Successes}

\n\textbf{Team Choice}

For our team choice, we are hoping to integrate the Algolia search API (\url{https://www.algolia.com/}) to make a fast and scalable search functionality that will allow for very efficient searching of the data in our application. Politifind has a ton of data, from thousands of bills to hundreds of politicians and their various voting data, and more. A quick and easy searching function would contribute well to our overall goal of Politifind, which is to make this political data more intuitively and easily accessible to the average person.
